Basically the image inside the display group is not observing the width as set (100px) due to some annoying style behaviours at the level of nesting. The hacky fix for this is specifying a </span><span><i>max-width </i></span><span>property which sort of forces it not to ignore the property (possibly could be resolved in the future with some changes to how images are displayed, but beyond scope for fixing right now) </span>"
